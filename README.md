Since forever ago, I’ve wanted to try writing assembly, even if just to understand why the [Rollercoaster Tycoon creator would write 99% of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#:~:text=Sawyer%20wrote%2099%25%20of%20the,%2C%20rendering%2C%20and%20paint%20programs.) in it.

Embarking on this quest, I quickly found a lot of scattered and difficult to understand resources. It took compiling a bunch of different materials together to come to a high level understanding of what’s happening in my computer.

I wanted to write down my learnings and make an approachable guide for people who are new to this part of their system (like me!), including working code examples. I hope you enjoy!
