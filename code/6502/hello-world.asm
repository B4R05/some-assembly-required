entry ;this is a label named 'entry' which can be referred to later on if needed. think of it as a function that can be called.

    lda #$00                ; load 0 into register a
    ldy #$0d                ; load $0b (as "hello world!" has 12 characters) into register y (register y will serve as index register, if you're not sure what this means, check out the README file in this folder)

character_loop ; this is also a label
    lda hello,y             ; load character number y of the string in label hello (hello world!) eg. when y is 2, load character "e"
    sta $0400,y             ; save data in register a to memory location $0400,y (= $0400 + y). Eg. when y is 2 (register a has the character "e"), $0400,2 = $0402, we'll load character "e" to memory location $0402
    dey                     ; decrement y by 1 (if y was 2, it is now 1)
    bpl character_loop      ; is y positive? if yes, then repeat by jumping back to label character_loop. as y decrements with each cycle (due to instruction in line 35), the cycle wil end when y is less than 0 and it will run the next line
    rts                     ; exit the program

hello
    !scr "hello world!" ; the label named "hello" contains the string we want to print
