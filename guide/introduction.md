This may sound counterintuitive, but computers aren't very smart. I know you may be shaking your head, insisting that my statement can't possibly be true, but I promise you that literally everything your computer is doing can be represented with just two values: **0** and **1**.

Now here's the catch - I said they're fundamentally simple, but I didn't say they're always easy to understand. Even though computers are, at their core, doing fairly simple tasks, they can be seriously confusing to learn about! We have to remember that computers have been built up layer by layer over a long period of time. These layers have produced the amazing, efficient, incredible machines that we use today. But, these layers also make learning about computers feel like a serious nightmare sometimes, because there's just *so much* to learn about.

Now, I will say that communicating with your CPU directly is generally quite unnecessary, as we now have higher level languages that are fast enough for most of our needs. That being said, the game [RollerCoaster Tycoon is written 99% in assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#:~:text=Sawyer%20wrote%2099%25%20of%20the,%2C%20rendering%2C%20and%20paint%20programs.). Not only that, but if you're writing operating systems, doing game engine development, or working on other low level systems, you're sometimes [writing assembly directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc) because you need things to be lightning fast.

Even though you or I may never _need_ to write assembly, I think that building an understanding of how your computer works at this level can be pretty dang empowering, and can help you appreciate all of the other stuff you do on your computer. In fact, the minute I wrote another program after writing in assembly, I was _so_ happy it wasn't assembly. Sorry assembly, I still love you!

I hope this guide helps you to demystify some of the lowest layers, and hopefully turn it from something that feels like magic to something that feels graspable. I personally didn’t know how these things worked before I started writing this guide, so I hope this helps you learn the things I’ve pieced together on my journey to understanding my computer better.
