## Writing Code

There are many different assembly languages, depending on the processor you want to talk to.

- X86 is one of the most useful assembly languages, but is also one of the more complicated ones to write. It's used for Intel processors, which have to process a lot of data!
- ARM is also useful but complicated, used for the new Apple M1 processors
- 6502 was used for older gaming systems (Atari and NES, for example), but is still used in small devices today
- Z80 is another one you might know - remember those TI-8X calculators you may have used in school? Well, to program those, you'd use the Z80 assembly language!
- RISC-V is a simpler assembly language, made for educational and research purposes

Given that the processor on my MacBook Pro is an Intel X86 64 bit processor, I will be using X86-64 assembly code to demonstrate assembly concepts. Yes, I know, my computer is old. Sorry.
