# Let's Write Some Code

It's the moment you've been waiting for, folks. We're going to write some code.

```js
// JavaScript
let x = 5;
```

#### Wait. Is that JavaScript? I thought this was about assembly.

Why yes, it is! We're just going to be giving examples of higher-level equivalents to help explain assembly language. Ok, back to our example.

As we talked about earlier, in higher level programming, you'd use a variable to store data for later use. You can think of registers as the variables of assembly language.

```js
// JavaScript
let myVar = 5;
```

- In JavaScript, we're setting the value of a variable, `myVar`, to the number `5`.

```asm
; X86-64 Assembly
mov rax, 5;
```

- In assembly, we're setting the value of a register, `rax`, to the number `5`.

We're using a **mov** instruction here (short for "Move"). This moves the value on the right side (`5`) _into_ the register on the left side (`rax`).

**INSERT ILLUSTRATION OF THIS HERE**

Now, variables and registers are quite similar in this regard, but there are some key differences to remember.

With **variables**, you can create an _unlimited amount_ of them and _name them whatever you'd like_.

**Registers**, on the other hand, are _limited_ to a set determined by the processor. You also _can't name them_, they're like already set up variables that you can change the contents of.

```js
// JavaScript
let myVar = 3;
let anotherVar = myVar;
```

- In JavaScript, we're setting the value of variable `myVar` to 3.

- Then we're setting the value of variable `anotherVar` to the contents of `myVar`.

- At the end of this, both `myVar` and `anotherVar` will contain the value `3`.

```asm
; X86-64 Assembly
mov rax, 3;
mov rbx, rax;
```

- In assembly, we're setting the value of a register, `rax` to 3.

- Then we're setting the value of register `rbx`, to the contents of the register `rax`.

- At the end of this, both `rax` and `rbx` will contain the value `3`.

---

One last `mov` example for you, just to drive the point home.

```js
// JavaScript
let myVar = 3;
let anotherVar = myVar;

let newVar = 5;
let anotherVar = newVar;
```

- In JavaScript, we're setting the value of variable `myVar` to 3.

- Then we're setting the value of variable `anotherVar` to the contents of `myVar`.

- Then, we set the value of `newVar` to 5, and set the value of `anotherVar` to the contents of `newVar`.

- At the end of this, both `newVar` and `anotherVar` will contain the value `5`, and `myVar` will still be `3`.

```asm
; X86-64 Assembly
mov rax, 3;
mov rbx, rax;

mov rcx, 5;
mov rbx, rcx;
```

- In assembly, we're setting the value of a register, `rax` to 3.

- Then we're setting the value of register `rbx`, to the contents of the register `rax`.

- Then, we assign `rcx` to 5, and set the value of `rbx` to the contents of `rcx`.

- At the end of this, both `rbx` and `rcx` will contain the value `5`, and `rax` will still be `3`.
