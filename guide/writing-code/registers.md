# Registers

Now that we know about data, we should talk about storing data. We covered registers in the [saving data](#saving-data) section briefly - registers are available for short term data storage on the CPU.

From [Stanford CS107](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1222/guide/x86-64.html), the table above lists the commonly used registers. Each register is 64 bits.

Some registers are designated for a certain purpose, such as `%rsp` being used as the stack pointer or `%rax` for the return value from a function.

## Caller-owned vs Callee-owned

Other registers are all-purpose, but have a conventional use depending on whether **caller-owned** or **callee-owned**.

For example, if the function `function1` calls `function2`, we refer to `function1` as the **caller** and `function2` as the **callee**. The registers used for the first 6 arguments and return value are all **callee-owned**.

That means that the **callee** can freely use those registers, overwriting existing values without taking any precautions. If `%rax` holds a value the **caller** wants to retain, the caller must copy the value to a "safe" location before making a call. The **callee-owned** registers are ideal for _scratch/temporary_ use by the **callee**.

In contrast, if the **callee** intends to use a **caller-owned** register, it must first _preserve its value_ and _restore it_ before exiting the call. The **caller-owned** registers are used for _local state_ of the **caller** that needs to preserved across further function calls.
