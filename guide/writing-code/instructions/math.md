# In Addition

Let's do a little bit of math. I swear it won't be bad!!

First, we'll talk about the `add` instruction.

```js
// JavaScript
let a = 3;
a = a + 1;
```
_In JavaScript, we're adding `1` to the contents of the variable `a`. At the end of this, `a` will contain the value `4`._

```asm
; X86-64 Assembly
mov rax, 3;
add rax, 1;
```
_In assembly, we're adding `1` to the contents of the register `rax`. At the end of this, `rax` will contain the value `4`._

The `add` instruction adds the value on the right side (`1`) to the contents of the register on the left side (`rax`, which contains `3`). It then takes the sum of these two numbers and, like our `mov` instruction, stores the value _into_ the register on the left side (`rax`).

---

Just like our `mov` instruction, the `add` instruction can use the contents of second register to operate on the first register.

```js
// JavaScript
let a = 3;
let b = 1;

a = a + b;
```
_In JavaScript, we're adding the contents of `b` to the contents of `a`. At the end of this, `a` will contain the value `4`._

```asm
; X86-64 Assembly
mov rax, 3;
mov rbx, 1;

add rax, rbx;
```
<details>
<summary><i>In assembly, what do you think the value of <code>rax</code> will be?</i></summary>

<br />
<i>We're adding the contents of `rbx` to the contents of `rax`. At the end of this, `rax` will contain the value `4`.</i>

</details>

## Subtraction

Subtraction works the same way as addition!

```js
// JavaScript
let a = 3;
let b = 1;

a = a - b;
```
_In JavaScript, we're minusing the contents of `b` from the contents of `a`. At the end of this, `a` will contain the value `2`._

```asm
; X86-64 Assembly
mov rax, 3;
mov rbx, 1;

sub rax, rbx;
```
<details>
<summary><i>In assembly, what do you think the value of <code>rax</code> will be?</i></summary>

<br />
<i>We're minusing the contents of `rbx` from the contents of `rax`. At the end of this, `rax` will contain the value `2`.</i>

</details>

The `sub` instruction subtracts the contents of the register (`rbx`, which contains `1`) on the right side to the contents of the register on the left side (`rax`, which contains `3`). It then takes the difference of these two numbers and stores the value _into_ the register on the left side (`rax`).

## Multiplication

Not all assembly languages have multiplication or division, but x86-64 does! Yay for us!

```js
// JavaScript
let a = 2;
let b = 3;

a = a * b;
```
_In JavaScript, we're multiplying the contents of `b` with the contents of `a`. At the end of this, `a` will contain the value `6`._

```asm
; X86-64 Assembly
mov rax, 2;
mov rbx, 3;

mul rax, rbx;
```
<details>
<summary><i>In assembly, we're multiplying the contents of <code>rbx</code> with the contents of <code>rax</code>. At the end of this, <code>rax</code> will contain the value <code>6</code>. Can you guess how the <code>mul</code> instruction works?</i></summary>

<br />
<i>The `mul` instruction multiplies the contents of the register (`rbx`, which contains `3`) on the right side to the contents of the register on the left side (`rax`, which contains `2`). It then takes the product of these two numbers and stores the value _into_ the register on the left side (`rax`).</i>

## Putting it together

Now that we have some basic math under our belt, let's try to map a real equation to assembly! You may remember the slope-intercept equation from school. If you're anything like me and don't remember it, it looks like:

> $y = mx + b$

We don't need to get into great detail about this equation, but this is the formula to find the equation of a straight line.

```asm
; X86-64 Assembly
mov rax, 2; rax will contain m
mov rbx, 3; rbx will contain x
mov rcx, 4; rcx will contain b

mul rax, rbx; m*x, store in rax
add rax, rcx; mx + b, store in rax. rax now contains y!
```
