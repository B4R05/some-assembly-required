# How Conventional

When I was learning this, I was like wow - we have a lot of places we can save things! We have a bunch of general-purpose registers we can use, and we have access to the stack. How do I know what to choose and when?

Every assembly language has its own set of **conventions** that dictate where a program expects things to be.

Let's take this JavaScript code, for example, where we're doing our handy dandy slope-intercept equation like before.

  <span>
    $y = mx + b$
  </span>
</p>
<br />

```js
// JavaScript
const y = getSlopeIntercept(3, 5, 2);

function getSlopeIntercept(m, x, b) {
    return ( m * x ) + b;
}
```

This code has a few things going on! We have three **arguments**, and we have a **return value**.

So far, we've been throwing everything into random general purpose registers (usually `rax` - `rdx`). Let's talk about some basic [conventions in x86-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#List_of_x86_calling_conventions):

1. Arguments get pushed on the stack to "pass" into the "function"
1. Arguments get popped off the stack and into registers to access inside of our "function"
1. "Return" values get saved in `rax`
1. General purpose registers can be "callee-owned" or "caller-owned" (more on this later)

<br />

```asm
; X86-64 Intel Syntax Assembly
push 3 ; m
push 5 ; x
push 2 ; b

; The stack is now (top) b, x, m (bottom)

call .getSlopeIntercept ; after this call, rax will contain our return value (17)

.getSlopeIntercept:
  ; arguments are popped in reverse order they were pushed on
  pop r8 ; b
  pop r9 ; x
  pop r10 ; m
  ; registers r8-r10 are "callee-owned"

  mul r10, r9
  add r10, r8

  ; return values go into rax
  mov rax, r10

  ret
```

## Caller-owned vs Callee-owned
General purpose registers have a convention where they're marked as **caller-owned** or **callee-owned**.

```asm
; X86-64 Intel Syntax Assembly
.fizz ; caller
  call .buzz ; callee
```

Let's take this code for example. If the function `fizz` calls function `buzz`, we refer to `fizz` as the **caller** and `buzz` as the **callee**. One register that is **callee-owned** is our return value register, `rax`.

That means that the **callee** (`fizz`) can freely use `rax`, overwriting existing values without taking any precautions.

However, if `rax` holds a value the **caller** (`buzz`) wants to retain, the **caller** (`buzz`) must copy the value into another register before making a `call`.

In contrast, if the **callee** (`fizz`) intends to use a **caller-owned** register, it must first preserve its value, and then restore it at the end before exiting the `call`.

If this is overwhelming, that's totally OK! I am still overwhelmed by it. That being said, you don't have to memorize or even know any of these conventions to write assembly. These are just good things to keep in mind if you're writing larger assembly programs, or you're collaborating with other people on writing assembly. When I was learning, I just used whatever registers I wanted, which is totally valid for you to do as well!
